# Titanic
Details on how to obtain a relatively high level of accuracy on Kaggle's "Titanic" Dataset.

The goal of this project is to predict weather a passenger  survived the titanic disaster, given several predictors.

We also utilize feature engineering to extract additional predictors, and combine multiple Machine Learning models to obtain predictions.

We also highlight some basic visualization techniques using ggplot.
